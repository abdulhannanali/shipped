# Adding Your Project

We'd love for you to add your project, no matter how small, and make the
gallery even more amazing :shipit:!

## The Setup

You just published the first iteration of Yelp for Yelp Reviews (YFYR), the
project you're working on, and shared it with your good friend and mortal
enemy, Jane Janeington. After Jane confirmed the viability of the idea, you're
now ready to share YFYR with the wider Hack Club community. Game on.

## The Fork

You've trained for this moment for days, but when you go to the `shipped` repo,
ready to share YFYR, you're faced with two options:

* Have [Hack Club's premade utility](https://shipit.hackclub.io) submit a [pull
  request](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request/) for
  you
* Submit the pull request manually

If you chose the former, head over to https://shipit.hackclub.io and follow the
instructions there. If you opted for the latter, keep following along.
