name: Pearl Runner
description: Too often, sexual education is dismissed as taboo in our culture. Through Pearl Runner, a young girl discovers the value of sexual health and safety by collecting condoms and avoiding the plague of STDs that are infecting her life. Inspired by stories of young girls overcoming sexual harassment, teenage pregnancy, and other consequences of poor sexual education, we strove to create a welcoming environment for users of all ages to learn and break down the walls of sexual taboo.
