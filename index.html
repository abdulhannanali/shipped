    {% comment %}
    We have to do this mess of for loops and the if statement because our
    directory structure is _data/projects/clubname/project.yml and Jekyll sees
    each directory and file as an array. Hopefully there's a better way to do
    this.
    {% endcomment %}
    {% for club in site.data.projects %}
      {% for project_file in club %}
        {% for projects in project_file %}
          {% for project in projects %}
            {% if project.name != null %}
              {% include project_card.html project=project %}
            {% endif %}
          {% endfor %}
        {% endfor %}
      {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

</div>
