    We have to do this mess of for loops and the if statement because our
    directory structure is _data/projects/clubname/project.yml and Jekyll sees
    each directory and file as an array. Hopefully there's a better way to do
    this.
    {% endcomment %}
    {% for project_file in site.data.projects %}
      {% for project in project_file %}
        {% if project.name != null %}
          {% include project_card.html project=project %}
        {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}
